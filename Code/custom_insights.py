This code analyzes match outcomes to determine which teams perform significantly better at home compared to away. 
It calculates total home wins and away wins for each team, computes win percentages for both situations.

This insight is useful for bettors and analysts to gauge the impact of home support, and for team managers 
to identify if a team might be struggling in away games.
